INSERT INTO `Roster_Staff` VALUES (1,1,'2005-2006','Tiller','Head Football Coach','Joe Tiller has put Purdue back on the college football map. \n\nWith each passing year, Joe Tiller further solidifies his reputation as one of the greatest coaches in Purdue football history — perhaps the greatest. \n\nTaking the reins of a program that had just one winning season (with the help of a forfeit victory) and no bowl game appearances since 1984, Tiller has engineered seven consecutive bowl berths, an average of nearly eight wins per season and a Big Ten championship in 2000. \n\nTiller’s Boilermakers have qualified for seven of the 12 bowl games in school history: 1997 Alamo, 1998 Alamo, 2000 Outback, 2001 Rose, 2001 Sun, 2002 Sun and 2004 Capital One. \n\nAs for Tiller, who was assistant head coach at Purdue from 1983 to 1986, his seven-year record with the Boilermakers stands at 55-32, a snappy .632 winning percentage. His 13-year head coaching record is 94-62-1, a .602 winning percentage. In Big Ten games, he is 36-20, a .643 winning percentage. \n\nDuring the 2002 season, Tiller became the second-winningest coach in school history, both for all games and Big Ten games. He trails only Jack Mollenkopf, who had 84 wins and 57 Big Ten wins from 1956 to 1969. Tiller also ranks second to Mollenkopf with 87 games coached. \n\nTiller presently is under contract that ensures his presence on the Purdue sideline at least through the 2010 campaign. Since signing a five-year contract to become the Boilermakers’ head coach, he has been awarded three separate two-year extensions (the first in January of 1998, the second in December of 1998 and the third in December of 1999) and a three-year extension in December of 2003. \n\nWe Will Win Again’ \n\nA new era in Purdue football began Nov. 22, 1996, when Tiller was introduced as the school’s 33rd head football coach. \n\nThe question everyone asked Tiller when he took over the program was, \"How long will it take to build a winning program?\" Tiller’s response: \"We\'re not going to wait for four years to figure this out. If I would wait four more years, I would hardly have any hair left. We\'re here to win a championship. We\'ve won in the past, and we will win again in the future.\" \n\nTiller delivered quick results. After losing to Toledo in the 1997 season opener, Purdue reeled off six straight wins. The dream season started with a 28-17 upset of No. 12 Notre Dame on Sept. 13, 1997. The victory broke an 11-year losing streak to the Fighting Irish. On Oct. 25, 1997, the Boilermakers defeated Illinois 48-3 to clinch just its second winning record since 1984 (Purdue was 5-4-2 in 1995 by virtue of a forfeit victory). \n\nPurdue finished with a 9-3 record (6-2 in the Big Ten — tied for second place), including a 33-20 victory over Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl, and a No. 15 national ranking. For a program that finished 3-8 overall in 1996, the six-game turnaround was the second best in the nation (behind only Western Michigan — 2-9 to 8-3). It also marked the second-greatest turnaround in school history behind the 1943 team that went 9-0 under head coach Elmer Burnham one year after the 1942 squad finished 1-8 under Burnham. \n\nAfter his first season at Purdue, Tiller was named National Coach of the Year by both Football News and Kickoff magazines, the GTE Region 3 Coach of the Year (Big Ten, Mid-American Conference and Conference USA) by the American Football Coaches Association and the Big Ten Dave McClain Coach of the Year. He also was a finalist for the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant National Coach of the Year and a finalist for National Coach of the Year by The Sporting News. \n\nThe Beat Goes On \n\nDespite having 17 players make their first collegiate start in 1998, the Boilermakers’ success continued. They finished with a 9-4 record (6-2 in the Big Ten — fourth place) and defended their Alamo Bowl title with a thrilling, come-from-behind 37-34 victory over fourth-ranked Kansas State. \n\nFor the second straight season, Purdue broke the school record for points (444) while also establishing standards for first downs (315), passing yards (4,208), total yards (5,719) and touchdowns (57). Purdue ranked seventh in the nation in passing offense (331.5) and 16th in total offense (457.0). \n\nThird Straight Winning Season \n\nIn 1999, the Boilermakers rolled to a 4-0 start and No. 10 national ranking (ESPN/USA Today) before playing five of their next six games against top 25 opponents. They stunned fifth-ranked Michigan State 52-28 and made it three straight Old Oaken Bucket wins over intrastate rival Indiana with a 30-24 victory. Purdue wound up with a 7-5 record (4-4 Big Ten — tied for sixth place) after losing to Georgia 28-25 in overtime in the Outback Bowl. The Boilermakers ranked fourth in the nation in passing offense (328.0) and eighth in total offense (456.0). \n\nGreat Expectations Realized \n\nWith quarterback Drew Brees returning for his senior season, expectations were sky-high for the 2000 campaign. With a 3-2 record in September, the Boilermakers faced a crossroads in October and delivered. They went 4-0 for the month (for just the fifth time in school history), winning all four games in come-from-behind fashion: 32-31 over sixth-ranked Michigan, 41-28 at 17th-ranked Northwestern, 30-24 in overtime at Wisconsin and 31-27 over 12th-ranked Ohio State. \n\nThe Boilermakers went on to capture their eighth Big Ten championship (first since 1967). They shared the crown with Michigan and Northwestern and earned the second Rose Bowl invitation in school history by virtue of wins over both the Wolverines and Wildcats. Purdue lost to No. 4 Washington 34-24 in the 87th Rose Bowl Game to finish with an 8-4 overall record (6-2 Big Ten). The Boilermakers ranked fourth nationally in total offense (471.2) and sixth in passing offense (312.5). \n\nTiller was an assistant coach for the 2001 Hula Bowl. \n\nBest Job Yet \n\nHaving lost five offensive starters to the National Football League, Tiller faced perhaps his greatest challenge in 2001. He responded with perhaps his best coaching job yet. While trying to find consistency on offense, the Boilermakers relied on defense and special teams to post a 6-6 overall record (4-4 Big Ten — tied for fourth place) and earn a trip to the Sun Bowl, where they lost to No. 13 Washington State 33-27.','tiller.jpg','Joe','ACTIVE'),(1,2,'2005-2006','Anarumo','Defensive Backs','Lou Anarumo is in his first season as defensive backs coach.

His 15-year head coaching record is 106-73-1, a .592 winning percentage. In Big Ten games, he is 43-29, a .597 winning percentage. \r\n\r\nOn Nov. 13, 2004, Tiller won his 100th career game with a 24-17 victory over Ohio State at Ross-Ade Stadium. \r\n\r\nTiller served as head coach of the East team in the East-West Shrine Game on Jan. 15, 2005, and earned a 45-27 victory. He played for the West team in 1963 and became just the fifth individual to play and coach in the Shrine Game. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2002 season, Tiller became the second-winningest coach in school history, both for all games and Big Ten games. He trails only Hall of Famer Jack Mollenkopf, who had 84 wins and 57 Big Ten wins from 1956 to 1969. Tiller also ranks second to Mollenkopf with 110 games coached. \r\n\r\nTiller presently is under contract that ensures his presence on the Purdue sideline at least through the 2010 campaign. Since signing a five-year contract to become the Boilermakers\' head coach, he has been awarded three separate two-year extensions (January of 1998, December of 1998 and December of 1999) and a three-year extension in December of 2003. \r\n\r\nA new era in Purdue football began Nov. 22, 1996, when Tiller was introduced as the school\'s 33rd head football coach. \r\n\r\nThe question everyone asked Tiller when he took over the program was, \"How long will it take to build a winning program?\" Tiller\'s response: \"We\'re not going to wait for four years to figure this out. If I would wait four more years, I would hardly have any hair left. We\'re here to win a championship. We\'ve won in the past, and we will win again in the future.\" \r\n\r\nTiller delivered quick results. After losing to Toledo in the 1997 season opener, Purdue reeled off six straight wins. The dream season started with a 28-17 upset of No. 12 Notre Dame on Sept. 13, 1997. The victory broke an 11-year losing streak to the Fighting Irish. On Oct. 25, 1997, the Boilermakers defeated Illinois 48-3 to clinch just its second winning record since 1984 (Purdue was 5-4-2 in 1995 by virtue of a forfeit victory). \r\n\r\nPurdue finished with a 9-3 record (6-2 in the Big Ten - tied for second place), including a 33-20 victory over Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl, and a No. 15 national ranking. For a program that finished 3-8 overall in 1996, the six-game turnaround was the second best in the nation (behind only Western Michigan - 2-9 to 8-3). It also marked the second-greatest turnaround in school history behind the 1943 team that went 9-0 under head coach Elmer Burnham one year after the 1942 squad finished 1-8 under Burnham. \r\n\r\nAfter his first season at Purdue, Tiller was named National Coach of the Year by both Football News and Kickoff magazines, the GTE Region 3 Coach of the Year (Big Ten, Mid-American Conference and Conference USA) by the American Football Coaches Association and the Big Ten Dave McClain Coach of the Year. He also was a finalist for the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant National Coach of the Year and a finalist for National Coach of the Year by The Sporting News. \r\n\r\nDespite having 17 players make their first collegiate start in 1998, the Boilermakers\' success continued. They finished with a 9-4 record (6-2 in the Big Ten - fourth place) and defended their Alamo Bowl title with a thrilling, come-from-behind 37-34 victory over fourth-ranked Kansas State. \r\n\r\nFor the second straight season, Purdue broke the school record for points (444) while also establishing standards for first downs (315), passing yards (4,208), total offense (5,719) and touchdowns (57). The Boilermakers ranked seventh in the nation in passing offense (331.5). \r\n\r\nIn 1999, the Boilermakers rolled to a 4-0 start and No. 10 national ranking (ESPN/USA Today) before playing five of their next six games against top 25 opponents. Purdue wound up with a 7-5 record (4-4 Big Ten - tied for sixth place) after losing to Georgia 28-25 in overtime in the Outback Bowl. The Boilermakers ranked fourth in the nation in passing offense (328.0) and eighth in total offense (456.0).  \r\n\r\nWith quarterback Drew Brees returning for his senior season, expectations were sky-high for the 2000 campaign. With a 3-2 record in September, the Boilermakers faced a crossroads in October and delivered. They went 4-0 for the month (for just the fifth time in school history), winning all four games in come-from-behind fashion: 32-31 over sixth-ranked Michigan, 41-28 at 17th-ranked Northwestern, 30-24 in overtime at Wisconsin and 31-27 over 12th-ranked Ohio State. \r\n\r\nThe Boilermakers went on to capture their eighth Big Ten championship (first since 1967). They shared the crown with Michigan and Northwestern and earned the second Rose Bowl invitation in school history by virtue of wins over both the Wolverines and Wildcats. Purdue lost to No. 4 Washington 34-24 in the 87th Rose Bowl Game to finish with an 8-4 overall record (6-2 Big Ten). The Boilermakers ranked fourth nationally in total offense (471.2) and sixth in passing offense (312.5). \r\n\r\nTiller was an assistant coach for the 2001 Hula Bowl. \r\n\r\nHaving lost five offensive starters to the National Football League, Tiller faced a formidable challenge in 2001. He responded with perhaps his best coaching job yet. While trying to find consistency on offense, the Boilermakers relied on defense and special teams to post a 6-6 overall record (4-4 Big Ten - tied for fourth place) and earn a trip to the Sun Bowl, where they lost to No. 13 Washington State 33-27.  \r\n\r\nTiller admits that the 2002 season was frustrating, as the Boilermakers went 7-6 overall (4-4 Big Ten - tied for fifth place), losing their six games by a combined 26 points (4.3 per game). Tiller praised his players for staying positive, and the reward was another bowl trip, a return to the Sun Bowl and a convincing 34-24 win over Pac-10 power Washington. \r\n\r\nAfter falling to 105th in the nation in total offense the previous year, the Boilermakers skyrocketed to seventh, averaging 452.2 yards per game. Purdue became just the 13th team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in total offense and total defense (317.2). \r\n\r\nWith 16 starters returning, big things were expected of the 2003 Boilermakers. After a season-opening loss to Bowling Green, Purdue rebounded to go 9-4 overall (6-2 Big Ten - tied for second place). The Boilermakers won all three of their trophy rivalry games and returned to the New Year\'s Day bowl scene with a trip to the Capital One Bowl to play Georgia. Purdue overcame a 24-0 deficit to the Bulldogs, only to fall 34-27 in overtime. In the final polls, Purdue was ranked 18th by The Associated Press and 19th by ESPN/USA Today. The Boilermakers ranked eighth in the nation in turnover margin, 10th in rushing defense, 13th in total defense and 14th in scoring defense. \r\n\r\nTiller was one of 11 coaches under consideration for the Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year Award. \r\n\r\nThe 2004 Boilermakers opened with five straight wins and climbed to No. 5 in the national polls. Four straight losses followed - by a combined 10 points - but Tiller, his staff and the players stayed the course and rebounded with victories over Ohio State and intrastate rival Indiana. They wound up 7-5 overall (4-4 Big Ten - tied for fifth place) following a last-minute 27-23 loss to Arizona State in the Sun Bowl. Purdue won all three of its trophy rivalry games for the second straight year, beating Notre Dame for the Shillelagh, Illinois for the Cannon and Indiana for the Old Oaken Bucket. \r\n\r\nThe Boilermakers ranked fourth in the nation in passing offense (321.2) and 13th in total offense (446.5). They set a Big Ten record with 763 yards of total offense against Indiana. Taylor Stubblefield became the NCAA career receptions leader with 316 catches and was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, presented to the nation\'s outstanding receiver. Defensively, despite losing seven starters to the NFL, Purdue allowed merely 17.2 points per game to rank 15th nationally. \r\n\r\nAll 11 starters returned on defense in 2005, resulting in lofty expectations. But after winning its first two games and climbing to No. 11 in The Associated Press national rankings, Purdue lost six in a row and failed to qualify for a bowl game for the first time under Tiller. The Boilermakers rebounded to win their last three games, including a 41-14 Old Oaken Bucket victory at Indiana on Nov. 19. The end result was a 5-6 overall record (3-5 Big Ten - eighth place). \r\n\r\nTiller returned to Purdue after posting a 39-30-1 record as head coach at Wyoming from 1991 to 1996. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Tiller led the Cowboys to a 10-2 record, the Western Athletic Conference title game and a No. 22 final national ranking by The Associated Press. He led Wyoming to its first top 25 finish since 1988. The Cowboys had the nation\'s longest winning streak for four weeks, ending at 12 games. Tiller was selected one of six finalists for the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year Award and was one of 10 finalists for the Football News National Coach of the Year. \r\n\r\nTiller\'s six seasons were highlighted by the Cowboys winning the 1996 WAC Pacific Division title and a share of the 1993 WAC Championship, earning a trip to the 1993 Copper Bowl. Following the 1993 and 1996 seasons, he was named the GTE Region 5 Coach of the Year (WAC and Big 12) by the American Football Coaches Association. \r\n\r\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Tiller compiled a 30-17 record. He was the first coach to lead the Cowboys to four consecutive seasons of six-plus wins since Lloyd Eaton (1966-69). \r\n\r\nDuring his tenure, Wyoming ranked in the top 20 nationally in passing offense and the top 30 in total offense each season. The 1996 Cowboys were No. 1 in passing offense (359.2), No. 3 in total offense (498.9) and No. 9 in scoring offense (38.7). \r\n\r\nIndividually, wide receiver Marcus Harris finished ninth in Heisman Trophy balloting and garnered the Biletnikoff Award in 1996. He set three NCAA records (4,518 career receiving yards, 24 100-yard games and the first player to have three consecutive 1,400-yard seasons). In 1996, Harris led the nation in receiving yards (137.5) and ranked second in receptions (109). Quarterback Josh Wallwork was tops in total offense (350.8) and fourth in passing efficiency (154.7). \r\n\r\nTiller\'s players set school season and career records for rushing, passing and receiving yards. Before Harris, Wyoming\'s Ryan Yarborough established the NCAA record for career receiving yards (4,357 from 1990 to 1993). So when he left Wyoming, Tiller had coached the top two receiving yards leaders in NCAA history. \r\n\r\nWyoming had three first team All-Americans in 1996: Harris, offensive tackle Steve Scifres and kicker Cory Wedel; two first team Academic All-Americans (for the first time in school history); and six first team All-WAC players. \r\n\r\nThe 1995 Cowboys had two first team All-Americans, one NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship recipient, two College Football Association National Scholar-Athletes and five first team All-WAC selections. They also led the WAC in academic all-conference selections for the first time in school history with eight. \r\n\r\nIn 1989 and 1990, Tiller was assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Washington State (under Mike Price). While with the Cougars he recruited and helped develop current Dallas Cowboys\' quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Prior to that, Tiller was offensive coordinator and offensive line coach at Wyoming (under Paul Roach) in 1987 and 1988. The Cowboys won back-to-back WAC titles and went to two Holiday Bowls. \r\n\r\nTiller\'s first stint at Purdue was from 1983 to 1986 as assistant head coach, defensive coordinator and defensive line coach (under Leon Burtnett). Among the players he coached was perennial NFL All-Pro defensive back Rod Woodson. In 1984, the Boilermakers played in the Peach Bowl. \r\n\r\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Tiller spent nine seasons with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He was an assistant coach (offensive and defensive lines) from 1974 to 1976, interim head coach for six games in 1976 (2-3-1 record), assistant general manager from 1977 to 1980 and director of administration and player personnel from 1980 to 1982. \r\n\r\nTiller was an assistant coach at Washington State from 1971 to 1973, spending one year as defensive line coach and two years as offensive coordinator and offensive line coach (under Jim Sweeney). \r\n\r\nIn 1965, Tiller began his coaching career as an assistant (offensive and defensive lines) at Montana State (under Sweeney). He was with the Bobcats through 1970. \r\n\r\nA native of Toledo, Ohio, Tiller attended Rogers High School and earned a B.S. degree in secondary education from Montana State in 1965. He was an honorable mention All-America offensive tackle and team captain for the Bobcats. Tiller was drafted by the Boston Patriots of the American Football League in 1964 (18th round) but did not sign. He played for Calgary of the CFL during the 1964 season. \r\n\r\nThe 63-year-old Tiller (he was born Dec. 7, 1942) and his wife, Arnette, have three children: Renee, Julie and Mike. They also have two golden retrievers, Millie and Patty. \r\n\r\nTiller is a member of the American Football Coaches Association and is in constant demand as a public speaker.

His 16-year head coaching record is 114-79-1, a .590 winning \r\npercentage. In Big Ten games, he is 48-32, a .600 winning percentage. \r\n\r\nOn Nov. 13, 2004, Tiller won his 100th career game with a 24-17 victory over \r\nOhio State at Ross-Ade Stadium. \r\n\r\nTiller served as head coach of the East team in the East-West Shrine Game on \r\nJan. 15, 2005, and earned a 45-27 victory. He played for the West team in 1963 \r\nand became just the fifth individual to play and coach in the Shrine Game. \r\n\r\nDuring the 2002 season, Tiller became the second-winningest coach in school \r\nhistory, both for all games and Big Ten games. He trails only Hall of Famer \r\nJack Mollenkopf, who had 84 wins and 57 Big Ten wins from 1956 to 1969. Tiller \r\nalso ranks second to Mollenkopf with 124 games coached. \r\n\r\nTiller presently is under contract that ensures his presence on the Purdue \r\nsideline at least through the 2010 campaign. Since signing a five-year \r\ncontract to become the Boilermakers\\\' head coach, he has been awarded three \r\nseparate two-year extensions (January of 1998, December of 1998 and December \r\nof 1999) and a three-year extension in December of 2003. \r\n\r\n`We Will Win Again\\\' \r\n\r\nA new era in Purdue football began Nov. 22, 1996, when Tiller was introduced \r\nas the school\\\'s 33rd head football coach. \r\n\r\nThe question everyone asked Tiller when he took over the program was, \\\"How \r\nlong will it take to build a winning program?\\\" Tiller\\\'s response: \\\"We\\\'re not \r\ngoing to wait for four years to figure this out. If I would wait four more \r\nyears, I would hardly have any hair left. We\\\'re here to win a championship. \r\nWe\\\'ve won in the past, and we will win again in the future.\\\" \r\n\r\nTiller delivered quick results. After losing to Toledo in the 1997 season \r\nopener, Purdue reeled off six straight wins. The dream season started with a \r\n28-17 upset of No. 12 Notre Dame on Sept. 13, 1997. The victory broke an 11-\r\nyear losing streak to the Fighting Irish. On Oct. 25, 1997, the Boilermakers \r\ndefeated Illinois 48-3 to clinch just its second winning record since 1984 \r\n(Purdue was 5-4-2 in 1995 by virtue of a forfeit victory). \r\n\r\nPurdue finished with a 9-3 record (6-2 in the Big Ten - tied for second \r\nplace), including a 33-20 victory over Oklahoma State in the Alamo Bowl, and a \r\nNo. 15 national ranking. For a program that finished 3-8 overall in 1996, the \r\nsix-game turnaround was the second best in the nation (behind only Western \r\nMichigan - 2-9 to 8-3). It also marked the second-greatest turnaround in \r\nschool history behind the 1943 team that went 9-0 under head coach Elmer \r\nBurnham one year after the 1942 squad finished 1-8 under Burnham. \r\n\r\nAfter his first season at Purdue, Tiller was named National Coach of the Year \r\nby both Football News and Kickoff magazines, the GTE Region 3 Coach of the \r\nYear (Big Ten, Mid-American Conference and Conference USA) by the American \r\nFootball Coaches Association and the Big Ten Dave McClain Coach of the Year. \r\nHe also was a finalist for the Paul \\\"Bear\\\" Bryant National Coach of the Year \r\nand a finalist for National Coach of the Year by The Sporting News. \r\n\r\nThe Beat Goes On \r\n\r\nDespite having 17 players make their first collegiate start in 1998, the \r\nBoilermakers\\\' success continued. They finished with a 9-4 record (6-2 in the \r\nBig Ten - fourth place) and defended their Alamo Bowl title with a thrilling, \r\ncome-from-behind 37-34 victory over fourth-ranked Kansas State. \r\n\r\nFor the second straight season, Purdue broke the school record for points \r\n(444) while also establishing standards for first downs (315), passing yards \r\n(4,208), total offense (5,719) and touchdowns (57). The Boilermakers ranked \r\nseventh in the nation in passing offense (331.5). \r\n\r\nThird Straight Winning Season \r\n\r\nIn 1999, the Boilermakers rolled to a 4-0 start and No. 10 national ranking \r\n(ESPN/USA Today) before playing five of their next six games against top 25 \r\nopponents. Purdue wound up with a 7-5 record (4-4 Big Ten - tied for sixth \r\nplace) after losing to Georgia 28-25 in overtime in the Outback Bowl. The \r\nBoilermakers ranked fourth in the nation in passing offense (328.0) and eighth \r\nin total offense (456.0). \r\n  \r\nGreat Expectations Realized \r\n\r\nWith quarterback Drew Brees returning for his senior season, expectations were \r\nsky-high for the 2000 campaign. With a 3-2 record in September, the \r\nBoilermakers faced a crossroads in October and delivered. They went 4-0 for \r\nthe month (for just the fifth time in school history), winning all four games \r\nin come-from-behind fashion: 32-31 over sixth-ranked Michigan, 41-28 at 17th-\r\nranked Northwestern, 30-24 in overtime at Wisconsin and 31-27 over 12th-ranked \r\nOhio State. \r\n\r\nThe Boilermakers went on to capture their eighth Big Ten championship (first \r\nsince 1967). They shared the crown with Michigan and Northwestern and earned \r\nthe second Rose Bowl invitation in school history by virtue of wins over both \r\nthe Wolverines and Wildcats. Purdue lost to No. 4 Washington 34-24 in the 87th \r\nRose Bowl Game to finish with an 8-4 overall record (6-2 Big Ten). The \r\nBoilermakers ranked fourth nationally in total offense (471.2) and sixth in \r\npassing offense (312.5). \r\n\r\nTiller was an assistant coach for the 2001 Hula Bowl. \r\n\r\nBest Job Yet \r\n\r\nHaving lost five offensive starters to the National Football League, Tiller \r\nfaced a formidable challenge in 2001. He responded with perhaps his best \r\ncoaching job yet. While trying to find consistency on offense, the \r\nBoilermakers relied on defense and special teams to post a 6-6 overall record \r\n(4-4 Big Ten - tied for fourth place) and earn a trip to the Sun Bowl, where \r\nthey lost to No. 13 Washington State 33-27. \r\n\r\nFrustrating But Rewarding \r\n\r\nTiller admits that the 2002 season was frustrating, as the Boilermakers went 7-\r\n6 overall (4-4 Big Ten - tied for fifth place), losing their six games by a \r\ncombined 26 points (4.3 per game). Tiller praised his players for staying \r\npositive, and the reward was another bowl trip, a return to the Sun Bowl and a \r\nconvincing 34-24 win over Pac-10 power Washington. \r\n\r\nAfter falling to 105th in the nation in total offense the previous year, the \r\nBoilermakers skyrocketed to seventh, averaging 452.2 yards per game. Purdue \r\nbecame just the 13th team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in total \r\noffense and total defense (317.2). \r\n\r\nPurdue Football: It\\\'s Big \r\n\r\nWith 16 starters returning, big things were expected of the 2003 Boilermakers. \r\nAfter a season-opening loss to Bowling Green, Purdue rebounded to go 9-4 \r\noverall (6-2 Big Ten - tied for second place). The Boilermakers won all three \r\nof their trophy rivalry games and returned to the New Year\\\'s Day bowl scene \r\nwith a trip to the Capital One Bowl to play Georgia. Purdue overcame a 24-0 \r\ndeficit to the Bulldogs, only to fall 34-27 in overtime. In the final polls, \r\nPurdue was ranked 18th by The Associated Press and 19th by ESPN/USA Today. The \r\nBoilermakers ranked eighth in the nation in turnover margin, 10th in rushing \r\ndefense, 13th in total defense and 14th in scoring defense. \r\n\r\nTiller was one of 11 coaches under consideration for the Bobby Dodd National \r\nCoach of the Year Award. \r\n\r\nStaying The Course \r\n\r\nThe 2004 Boilermakers opened with five straight wins and climbed to No. 5 in \r\nthe national polls. Four straight losses followed - by a combined 10 points - \r\nbut Tiller, his staff and the players stayed the course and rebounded with \r\nvictories over Ohio State and intrastate rival Indiana. They wound up 7-5 \r\noverall (4-4 Big Ten - tied for fifth place) following a last-minute 27-23 \r\nloss to Arizona State in the Sun Bowl. Purdue won all three of its trophy \r\nrivalry games for the second straight year, beating Notre Dame for the \r\nShillelagh, Illinois for the Cannon and Indiana for the Old Oaken Bucket. \r\n\r\nThe Boilermakers ranked fourth in the nation in passing offense (321.2) and \r\n13th in total offense (446.5). They set a Big Ten record with 763 yards of \r\ntotal offense against Indiana. Taylor Stubblefield became the NCAA career \r\nreceptions leader with 316 catches and was a finalist for the Biletnikoff \r\nAward, presented to the nation\\\'s outstanding receiver. Defensively, despite \r\nlosing seven starters to the NFL, Purdue allowed merely 17.2 points per game \r\nto rank 15th nationally. \r\n  \r\nStreak Snapped \r\n\r\nAll 11 starters returned on defense in 2005, resulting in lofty expectations. \r\nBut after winning its first two games and climbing to No. 11 in The Associated \r\nPress national rankings, Purdue lost six in a row and failed to qualify for a \r\nbowl game for the first time under Tiller. The Boilermakers rebounded to win \r\ntheir last three games, including a 41-14 Old Oaken Bucket victory at Indiana \r\non Nov. 19. The end result was a 5-6 overall record (3-5 Big Ten - eighth \r\nplace). \r\n\r\nBack To Bowling \r\n\r\nDespite a turnover of five assistant coaches and being the nation\\\'s only team \r\nto play 13 regular-season games without a bye week, the Boilermakers returned \r\nto the bowl scene in 2006, finishing 8-6 overall (5-3 Big Ten - tied for \r\nfourth place) with a 24-7 loss to Maryland in the Champs Sports Bowl. Purdue, \r\nwhich had 20 players make their first career starts, became one of 16 schools \r\nto play in a bowl game in at least nine of the last 10 seasons. \r\n\r\nThe Boilermakers led the Big Ten in passing offense (291.6) and in total \r\noffense (415.7). Those averages ranked sixth and 13th nationally. Curtis \r\nPainter, with the benefit of playing one more game, broke Drew Brees\\\' Big Ten \r\nseason record with 3,985 passing yards. Mike Otto set a school record with 50 \r\ncareer starts at left offensive tackle - every game he played over four \r\nseasons. \r\n\r\nA youth-laden defense was anchored by Anthony Spencer, who led the nation with \r\n26.5 tackles for loss en route to becoming the first Purdue defensive lineman \r\nto earn first team All-America honors since tackle Ken Novak in 1975 and first \r\ndefensive end since Harold Wells in 1964. The Boilermakers forced 23 fumbles, \r\nthe second-most in school history, and recovered 17 fumbles, tied for the \r\nfifth-most nationally. \r\n\r\nA school-record 15 football players earned Academic All-Big Ten honors. \r\n\r\nWinning In Wyoming \r\n\r\nTiller returned to Purdue after posting a 39-30-1 record as head coach at \r\nWyoming from 1991 to 1996. \r\n\r\nIn 1996, Tiller led the Cowboys to a 10-2 record, the Western Athletic \r\nConference title game and a No. 22 final national ranking by The Associated \r\nPress. He led Wyoming to its first top 25 finish since 1988. The Cowboys had \r\nthe nation\\\'s longest winning streak for four weeks, ending at 12 games. Tiller \r\nwas selected one of six finalists for the Paul \\\"Bear\\\" Bryant Coach of the Year \r\nAward and was one of 10 finalists for the Football News National Coach of the \r\nYear. \r\n\r\nTiller\\\'s six seasons were highlighted by the Cowboys winning the 1996 WAC \r\nPacific Division title and a share of the 1993 WAC Championship, earning a \r\ntrip to the 1993 Copper Bowl. Following the 1993 and 1996 seasons, he was \r\nnamed the GTE Region 5 Coach of the Year (WAC and Big 12) by the American \r\nFootball Coaches Association. \r\n\r\nFrom 1993 to 1996, Tiller compiled a 30-17 record. He was the first coach to \r\nlead the Cowboys to four consecutive seasons of six-plus wins since Lloyd \r\nEaton (1966-69). \r\n\r\nDuring his tenure, Wyoming ranked in the top 20 nationally in passing offense \r\nand the top 30 in total offense each season. The 1996 Cowboys were No. 1 in \r\npassing offense (359.2), No. 3 in total offense (498.9) and No. 9 in scoring \r\noffense (38.7). \r\n\r\nIndividually, wide receiver Marcus Harris finished ninth in Heisman Trophy \r\nballoting and garnered the Biletnikoff Award in 1996. He set three NCAA \r\nrecords (4,518 career receiving yards, 24 100-yard games and the first player \r\nto have three consecutive 1,400-yard seasons). In 1996, Harris led the nation \r\nin receiving yards (137.5) and ranked second in receptions (109). Quarterback \r\nJosh Wallwork was tops in total offense (350.8) and fourth in passing \r\nefficiency (154.7). \r\n\r\nTiller\\\'s players set school season and career records for rushing, passing and \r\nreceiving yards. Before Harris, Wyoming\\\'s Ryan Yarborough established the NCAA \r\nrecord for career receiving yards (4,357 from 1990 to 1993). So when he left \r\nWyoming, Tiller had coached the top two receiving yards leaders in NCAA \r\nhistory. \r\n\r\nWyoming had three first team All-Americans in 1996: Harris, offensive tackle \r\nSteve Scifres and kicker Cory Wedel; two first team Academic All-Americans \r\n(for the first time in school history); and six first team All-WAC players. \r\n\r\nThe 1995 Cowboys had two first team All-Americans, one NCAA Postgraduate \r\nScholarship recipient, two College Football Association National Scholar-\r\nAthletes and five first team All-WAC selections. They also led the WAC in \r\nacademic all-conference selections for the first time in school history with \r\neight. \r\n\r\nThe Road To Success \r\n\r\nIn 1989 and 1990, Tiller was assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and \r\noffensive line coach at Washington State (under Mike Price). While with the \r\nCougars he recruited and helped develop current Dallas Cowboys\\\' quarterback \r\nDrew Bledsoe. Prior to that, Tiller was offensive coordinator and offensive \r\nline coach at Wyoming (under Paul Roach) in 1987 and 1988. The Cowboys won \r\nback-to-back WAC titles and went to two Holiday Bowls. \r\n\r\nTiller\\\'s first stint at Purdue was from 1983 to 1986 as assistant head coach, \r\ndefensive coordinator and defensive line coach (under Leon Burtnett). Among \r\nthe players he coached was perennial NFL All-Pro defensive back Rod Woodson. \r\nIn 1984, the Boilermakers played in the Peach Bowl. \r\n\r\nFrom 1974 to 1982, Tiller spent nine seasons with the Calgary Stampeders of \r\nthe Canadian Football League. He was an assistant coach (offensive and \r\ndefensive lines) from 1974 to 1976, interim head coach for six games in 1976 \r\n(2-3-1 record), assistant general manager from 1977 to 1980 and director of \r\nadministration and player personnel from 1980 to 1982. \r\n\r\nTiller was an assistant coach at Washington State from 1971 to 1973, spending \r\none year as defensive line coach and two years as offensive coordinator and \r\noffensive line coach (under Jim Sweeney). \r\n\r\nIn 1965, Tiller began his coaching career as an assistant (offensive and \r\ndefensive lines) at Montana State (under Sweeney). He was with the Bobcats \r\nthrough 1970. \r\n\r\nThe Tiller Family: In front, Arnette and Joe; in the middle, son-in-law Jason \r\nFish (Julie\\\'s husband) and daughter Renee; in back, daughter Julie and son \r\nMike.\r\n\r\nA native of Toledo, Ohio, Tiller attended Rogers High School and earned a B.S. \r\ndegree in secondary education from Montana State in 1965. He was an honorable \r\nmention All-America offensive tackle and team captain for the Bobcats. Tiller \r\nwas drafted by the Boston Patriots of the American Football League in 1964 \r\n(18th round) but did not sign. He played for Calgary of the CFL during the \r\n1964 season. \r\n\r\nThe 64-year-old Tiller (he was born Dec. 7, 1942) and his wife, Arnette, have \r\nthree children: Renee, Julie and Mike. They also have two golden retrievers, \r\nMillie and Sami. \r\n\r\nTiller is a member of the American Football Coaches Association and is in \r\nconstant demand as a public speaker. In 2004, he was instrumental in the \r\nformation of the Northwest Indiana chapter of the National Football \r\nFoundation, promoting youth football. The chapter was renamed in his honor in \r\nJune of 2007. His autobiography, Tiller: Not Your Average Joe, was published \r\nin 2006.','Tiller0.jpg','Joe','ACTIVE');
