Greetings, new/returning eStadium member!

I am glad you are here to read this document.

Before you proceed developing, please take a look at:

* docs/ folder
    * for project documentation from Spring 2015
* or wiki page for the same content
* and some Angular/Ionic tutorials
    
If you had experiences with both, you can probably skip tutorials

But please don't skip the project documentation

API documentation on the wiki page can also be helpful if you are adding network calls to the backend 

Happy hacking :)
